## Data Sources

This server accesses Swiss BAG (Federal Office of Public Health) data — all without authentication:

| Source | Documentation |
|--------|--------------|
| Spezialitaetenliste (SL) | [sl.bag.admin.ch](https://sl.bag.admin.ch) |
| GGSL | [BAG GGSL Info](https://www.bag.admin.ch) |
| MiGeL | [BAG MiGeL Info](https://www.bag.admin.ch) |

### Phase 2: FHIR API

When the BAG publishes its FHIR/IDMP API for the ePL, contributions updating the tools to use it are very welcome. The architecture is designed to make this upgrade minimal — see the `FHIR_BASE_URL` constant and the `_sl_website_suche` function in `server.py`.

When adding new data sources, follow the **No-Auth-First** principle: Phase 1 uses only open, authentication-free endpoints. Authenticated APIs are introduced in later phases with graceful degradation.
