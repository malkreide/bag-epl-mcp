# MCP-Server Re-Audit — `bag-epl-mcp`

> Re-audit with the [mcp-audit-skill](https://github.com/malkreide/mcp-audit-skill) (v1.0.0, 68-check catalog) after Phase 1–3 remediation (PRs #2, #3, #4).
> Baseline: [`../2026-06-01/AUDIT-REPORT.md`](../2026-06-01/AUDIT-REPORT.md). All numbers derive from [`summary.json`](./summary.json).

## 1. Executive Summary

After three remediation phases, the server moved from **11 pass / 26 partial / 7 fail** to **34 pass / 10 partial / 0 fail** across the 44 applicable checks. **All 7 failed checks and 16 partials were resolved**, including the advertised-but-unimplemented cloud transport (the baseline's headline defect) and 3 of the 4 critical items.

**Production-readiness: `true`** for the documented **Phase-1, single-instance** deployment. There are **no failed checks** and no unaddressed criticals. The single remaining critical (SEC-009) is a **documented accepted-risk** (no authentication, public read-only data). The other 9 partials are either documented accepted-risk or deferred to Phase 2 / multi-instance scaling — none block a Phase-1 release.

## 2. Score Delta vs. Baseline

| Status | Baseline (2026-06-01) | Re-audit | Δ |
|--------|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| Pass | 11 | **34** | **+23** |
| Partial | 26 | **10** | **−16** |
| Fail | 7 | **0** | **−7** |
| Findings (partial+fail) | 33 | **10** | **−23** |

| Findings by severity | Baseline | Re-audit |
|---|:---:|:---:|
| Critical | 4 | **1** (accepted-risk) |
| High | 16 | **3** (deferred) |
| Medium | 13 | **6** |
| Low | 0 | 0 |

Profile unchanged: dual transport · no auth · Public Open Data · read-only · Render + local-stdio.

## 3. Resolved Findings (23)

| ID | Title | Baseline → Re-audit | Evidence |

| CH-004 | OGD-CH licence | partial → **pass** | `provenance` block + CC BY 4.0 footer; README sources |
| OPS-001/002/003 | Test split / docs / roadmap | partial → **pass** | `test_unit.py`+`test_live.py`; data-flow diagram; `docs/ROADMAP.md` |

## 4. Remaining Findings (10) — none blocking Phase 1

| ID | Sev | Status | Disposition | Note |
|----|----|--------|-------------|------|
| SEC-009 | critical | partial | **accepted-risk** | No auth → no session binding by design (public read-only, single instance). Documented in `docs/SECURITY.md §3`. Re-introduce signed binding if auth is ever added. |
| SEC-005 | high | partial | **deferred** | Allow-list + IP blocklist done; full DNS-pinning (reuse one resolution for the TCP connection) pending. Low residual risk (fixed admin.ch hosts). |
| SCALE-002 | high | partial | **deferred (multi-instance)** | Sticky sessions / shared store only needed when scaled; single-instance documented. |
| SCALE-003 | high | partial | **deferred (multi-instance)** | Edge-LB session routing only for >1 replica. |
| SDK-002 | medium | partial | **by-design** | Consistent JSON envelope added; return annotation kept `str` to preserve Markdown UX. |
| SDK-003 | medium | partial | open | No `ctx: Context` injection / progress reporting (tools are short-lived). |
| SEC-014 | medium | partial | accepted-risk | No gateway allow-list; documented (single public read-only server). |
| SEC-015 | medium | partial | accepted-risk | No pre-flight tool-poisoning detection; static own tools. |
| OBS-003 | medium | partial | open | Structured logging present; per-call `session_id`/`correlation_id` binding pending (needs SDK-003). |
| OBS-006 | medium | partial | opt-in | OTel available via `[otel]` extra; not configured/enabled by default. |

**Recommended next steps (optional, non-blocking):** implement DNS-pinning (SEC-005) and `ctx`-based per-call logging (SDK-003 + OBS-003) in a small follow-up; address SCALE-002/003 only when moving to multi-instance; configure OTel at deploy time if tracing is desired.

## 5. Non-Applicable Categories (24) — unchanged

All OAuth/auth checks (`auth_model == none`), PII/DSG/residency/SIEM/DLP/breach checks (`Public Open Data`), Volksschule/Stadt-Zürich/Schulamt/enterprise context, all HITL (no sampling, read-only), `write_capable == false` (ARCH-010, HITL-005), filesystem (SEC-017), TypeScript (SDK-005). See baseline report §7.

---

## 6. Release Proposal (Step 7 — requires confirmation)

`production_ready == true`, so a release is proposed. **Not executed** — awaiting explicit confirmation; nothing is tagged or pushed automatically.

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Current version | `0.1.0` |
| Recommended | **`0.2.0`** (minor) |
| Rationale | Backward-compatible feature additions (env-based HTTP transport, security hardening, structured envelopes, Docker, structured logging). No breaking changes to existing tool signatures. |
| Action on confirm | Bump `pyproject.toml` + `__init__`/`epl_server_info` version, move the CHANGELOG `[Unreleased]` block to `[0.2.0] - <date>`, create a `v0.2.0` git tag + GitHub release draft (which triggers the PyPI publish workflow + tool-hash snapshot). |

> Scope note: the readiness verdict covers **Phase-1, single-instance** deployment as documented in `docs/SECURITY.md` and `docs/ROADMAP.md`. Horizontal scaling requires SCALE-002/003; adding authentication requires revisiting SEC-009.
